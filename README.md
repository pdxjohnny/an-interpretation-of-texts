**Introduction**

In various spiritual traditions, particularly Gnostic teachings, the material world is seen as a realm of deception crafted by a lesser deity known as **Saklas**, meaning "fool" or "blind one." Saklas is believed to have created humanity in his own flawed image, misleading people into thinking he is the true God. However, the **true God has no name** and transcends all human labels and concepts. The New Testament introduces a New Covenant through Jesus Christ, providing a path to overcome Saklas's deception and reconnect with the nameless, supreme God.

**Saklas's Deceptive Creation Entraps Humanity**

- **Imitation of Divine Authority**: Saklas mimics the true God's creative act by declaring, "Let's create a human being after the likeness and the image." However, his creation is a distorted reflection, designed to keep souls unaware of their authentic divine nature. By giving himself a name and asserting authority, Saklas presents a false image of divinity.

- **Entrapment in Materiality**: By forming humans in his imperfect image, Saklas binds the divine spark within physical bodies, subjecting souls to the limitations and sufferings of the material world. This deception keeps humanity ignorant of their true origin with the nameless, supreme God who exists beyond all forms and names.

**The Old Covenant Associated with Saklas**

- **Emphasis on External Laws**: The Old Covenant, as presented in the Old Testament, focuses on strict adherence to laws and rituals. In the Gnostic perspective, this legalistic approach is linked to Saklas's material world, emphasizing external compliance over inner understanding of the divine.

- **Perpetuation of Ignorance**: The old laws address behavior but do not liberate the soul from the material world's deception. They can keep individuals focused on the physical realm rather than seeking deeper spiritual truths about the nameless God.

**The New Covenant as the Path to the Nameless Divine Truth**

1. **Spiritual Liberation Over Legalism**: The New Covenant shifts the focus from external laws to internal transformation through love and grace. Jesus teaches that true fulfillment comes from a change of heart, not merely following rules. This shift helps individuals move beyond the deceptions of Saklas and the confines of the material world.

2. **Revealing the True God Beyond Names**: Jesus introduces the concept of a God who transcends all human labels and descriptions. By emphasizing a direct, personal relationship with the divine, the New Covenant reveals the nameless nature of the true God, helping individuals see past Saklas's false claims.

3. **Centrality of Love**: Jesus summarizes the law with two commandments: love God and love your neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40). This emphasis on love replaces numerous old laws and becomes the guiding principle for spiritual growth, aligning believers with the essence of the nameless, supreme God.

4. **Inner Guidance of the Holy Spirit**: The New Covenant introduces the Holy Spirit as an inner guide. This divine presence empowers believers to navigate life's challenges, offering wisdom beyond external regulations and connecting them to the true God beyond names.

5. **Restoration of Divine Connection**: The New Covenant restores a direct relationship between humanity and the true God, bypassing intermediaries like Saklas who seek to keep humanity in darkness. By following Jesus's teachings, individuals can reconnect with the ultimate God who is beyond all labels and forms.

**Overcoming Deception by Recognizing that God Has No Name and Following the New Testament**

- **Seeing Through Saklas's Illusions**: By understanding that the true God has no name and cannot be confined by human concepts, individuals can recognize the falsity of Saklas's claims. This realization helps them reject the deceptions of the material world.

- **Embracing the Teachings of the New Testament**: Following the principles of love, forgiveness, and grace outlined in the New Testament enables people to overcome ignorance. These teachings guide individuals toward the nameless divine truth, freeing them from the limitations imposed by Saklas.

- **Achieving Ultimate Spiritual Fulfillment**: Recognizing the nameless nature of the true God and adhering to Jesus's teachings allows individuals to shed false identities tied to the material realm. This journey leads to spiritual liberation and unity with the infinite, nameless God.

**Conclusion**

Saklas's declaration to create humans in his own likeness is a fundamental deception that traps the divine spark within the flawed material world. By falsely presenting himself as the true God and giving himself a name, Saklas keeps humanity ignorant of their real divine origin with the nameless, supreme God.

The New Covenant introduced by Jesus is crucial because it offers a path to spiritual liberation. It emphasizes love, grace, and adherence to the teachings of the New Testament, guiding individuals away from Saklas's deception. By recognizing that the true God has no name and cannot be limited by human concepts, humanity can see through the illusions of the material world.

Following the New Covenant allows individuals to reconnect with the ultimate God beyond all labels and forms. Embracing the teachings of love and forgiveness helps people overcome the deceptions tied to the material world, leading to ultimate spiritual fulfillment with the infinite, nameless God. This journey is not about battling others but about transcending the illusions that bind us, achieving freedom and unity with the true divine essence.
