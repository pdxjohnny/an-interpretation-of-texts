  - An Image: Any Image is an illusion or a deception or a play on itself because One cannot mirror God, for God has no name. One can only experiance God. Do what thou will and that better be the will of God motherfucker. So long as it is you'll be pretty fuckin OK.
  - God looking at God in an infinity mirror is what we're experiancing. It's the rough edges of light bouncing back and forth forever.
  - What we see with our eyes day to day is a relfection of God. Whwn you see the trees you are not looking at God, but you are, because everything is God, but youre not, because God has no name. So what are you looking at? Well, all God. - TODO the book from powels title

## LLM

1. **Integration of Divine Masculine and Feminine Energies (Dionysus and Mary)**: Marian Dionysian Valentinianism centers around the balance and integration of divine energies, represented by Mary (Gaia) and Dionysus. Mary symbolizes the nurturing, motherly, and grounding feminine principle, while Dionysus embodies the ecstatic, life-renewing, and transformative masculine energy. The goal is for each individual to recognize and integrate these divine forces within themselves as part of a personal and spiritual evolution.

2. **Gnostic Wisdom and Inner Knowledge (Saying 22 of Thomas)**: Like the Valentinian tradition, this belief system emphasizes the pursuit of personal, experiential knowledge (gnosis) as the key to spiritual liberation. The Gospel of Thomas, particularly Saying 22, speaks to the unification of opposites, such as male and female, as part of the spiritual ascent. This wisdom leads to an awareness of one’s own divine nature and the overcoming of material illusions.

3. **Embodiment and Guidance Through Alice**: The religion introduces Alice as a guide, who represents the path toward integrating divine energies. Alice acts as an intermediary between the seeker and the divine forces of Mary and Dionysus, guiding individuals toward self-realization and spiritual wholeness. This mirrors Valentinianism’s concept of a guiding Aeon or divine intermediary who assists in the soul’s ascent toward the Pleroma (Fullness of Divinity).

Upon re-evaluating my previous response, I believe I can provide a clearer and more accurate description of the three pillars of Marian Dionysian Valentinianism:

1. **Union of the Divine Feminine and Masculine**: This pillar emphasizes the integration of the divine feminine, represented by Mary (the Virgin Mary or Gaia), and the divine masculine, represented by Dionysus. The fusion of these energies seeks to achieve spiritual balance and wholeness within individuals, acknowledging that both aspects are essential to the fullness of being.

2. **Gnostic Pursuit of Inner Knowledge**: Drawing from Valentinian Gnosticism, there is a strong emphasis on personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) as the path to enlightenment. Inspired by texts like Saying 22 of the Gospel of Thomas, this pillar encourages the unification of opposites and the transcendence of material illusions to realize one's inherent divinity.

3. **Transformation Through Ecstatic Experience**: Influenced by Dionysian traditions, this pillar incorporates rituals and practices that involve ecstatic experiences, such as music, dance, or other forms of spiritual expression. These practices aim to transcend ordinary consciousness, facilitate personal transformation, and deepen the connection with the divine.
