Nhialism is great, its a blank check. However,its more fun if there's a story, so hence religion.

## wtf

- We're in a [sandbox]()
  - This is a sandbox of our own creation. We've self limited and renfocred limiting factors via built up "this is the way its always been done"
- Gods are architypes which represent gamemasters.
  - Feeding these architypes through the activities of your life helps you understand and master the properties of these architypes yourself.
  - Understanding of these tricks (if you will) and experiance applying them is how we sort of seed lady luck to help theses these happen more naturally over time.
