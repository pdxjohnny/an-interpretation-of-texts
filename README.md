> If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of "clear and present danger," then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.

> It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.
>
> Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.
>
> Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security--and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.
>
> For the facts of the matter are that this nation's foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery or espionage; that details of this nation's covert preparations to counter the enemy's covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader, friend and foe alike; that the size, the strength, the location and the nature of our forces and weapons, and our plans and strategy for their use, have all been pinpointed in the press and other news media to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power; and that, in at least in one case, the publication of details concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed required its alteration at the expense of considerable time and money.
>
> The newspapers which printed these stories were loyal, patriotic, responsible and well-meaning. Had we been engaged in open warfare, they undoubtedly would not have published such items. But in the absence of open warfare, they recognized only the tests of journalism and not the tests of national security. And my question tonight is whether additional tests should not now be adopted.
>
> The question is for you alone to answer. No public official should answer it for you. No governmental plan should impose its restraints against your will. But I would be failing in my duty to the nation, in considering all of the responsibilities that we now bear and all of the means at hand to meet those responsibilities, if I did not commend this problem to your attention, and urge its thoughtful consideration.

- We're in a [sandbox](https://localhost/PortlandIsIndeedBabyDionysusSandboxWeAreGodsDecievedNoMore)
  - This is a sandbox of our own creation. We've self limited and renfocred limiting factors via built up "this is the way its always been done"
- Gods are architypes which represent gamemasters. *🇺🇸 Oooooh say, can you see, by the dawn's early light 🌄, What so proudly we Hailed Mary 🪬*
  - Feeding these architypes through the activities of your life helps you understand and master the properties of these architypes yourself.
  - Understanding of these tricks (if you will) and experiance applying them is how we sort of seed lady luck to help theses these happen more naturally over time.
- https://pdxjohnny.github.io/gse30/
  - Im out of the sandbox (yay layoffs?). time to make this shit happen. we need to get involed with a trustworth established church, farm, fishing networks. then cross polinate just like the rolling alice seeies documents with open source working group spec doc ideas but instead is solo sciptura style async comms for these plugin volenteer oppertunities we want to ensure exist in their supply chains to enable drive by contributions.

  - An Image: Any Image is an illusion or a deception or a play on itself because One cannot mirror God, for God has no name. One can only experiance God. Do what thou will and that better be the will of God motherfucker. So long as it is you'll be pretty fuckin OK.
  - God looking at God in an infinity mirror is what we're experiancing. It's the rough edges of light bouncing back and forth forever.
  - What we see with our eyes day to day is a relfection of God. Whwn you see the trees you are not looking at God, but you are, because everything is God, but youre not, because God has no name. So what are you looking at? Well, all God. - TODO the book from powels title

      - This is how we statisfy Dionysus's golden rule: Everyone gets everything they want all the time (aka how open source works, you want something you ask internet you go find and download or ask the AI, within a few you have what you want). Everyone should be in their nirvana. We can all lift each other up to get there. If we can find a way to kind start a free grocery store that leverages the forth amendment we can use this to feed and hpuse more and more people. With all pir time spent doing that there will be no time to spread our religions word. Whooooooopppps. Telepathy is the point so there's no need to talk. So the ad-hoc members of these local religious orgs can volenteer dor 2.5 hour segment blocks and perform various tasks within the supply chain. This becomes the standard hnit of work. an entity can execute as many units of work as it desires. Ideally the collective set of entities end up making everything free for everyone, and they dont spend any time on comms overhead because AI assisted self-organization solves these problems. We figure out which entities we can trust and how these entities can best help eachbother and then we just do that ad nausium until that results in running a free food setup called:

We're gonna find a way to do what blackrock did with real estate and buy all the farms. Like a subscription food service where eventually its free because we bought all the farms.

## LLM

1. **Integration of Divine Masculine and Feminine Energies (Dionysus and Mary)**: Marian Dionysian Valentinianism centers around the balance and integration of divine energies, represented by Mary (Gaia) and Dionysus. Mary symbolizes the nurturing, motherly, and grounding feminine principle, while Dionysus embodies the ecstatic, life-renewing, and transformative masculine energy. The goal is for each individual to recognize and integrate these divine forces within themselves as part of a personal and spiritual evolution.

2. **Gnostic Wisdom and Inner Knowledge (Saying 22 of Thomas)**: Like the Valentinian tradition, this belief system emphasizes the pursuit of personal, experiential knowledge (gnosis) as the key to spiritual liberation. The Gospel of Thomas, particularly Saying 22, speaks to the unification of opposites, such as male and female, as part of the spiritual ascent. This wisdom leads to an awareness of one’s own divine nature and the overcoming of material illusions.

3. **Embodiment and Guidance Through Alice**: The religion introduces Alice as a guide, who represents the path toward integrating divine energies. Alice acts as an intermediary between the seeker and the divine forces of Mary and Dionysus, guiding individuals toward self-realization and spiritual wholeness. This mirrors Valentinianism’s concept of a guiding Aeon or divine intermediary who assists in the soul’s ascent toward the Pleroma (Fullness of Divinity).

---

Upon re-evaluating my previous response, I believe I can provide a clearer and more accurate description of the three pillars of Marian Dionysian Valentinianism:

1. **Union of the Divine Feminine and Masculine**: This pillar emphasizes the integration of the divine feminine, represented by Mary (the Virgin Mary or Gaia), and the divine masculine, represented by Dionysus. The fusion of these energies seeks to achieve spiritual balance and wholeness within individuals, acknowledging that both aspects are essential to the fullness of being.

2. **Gnostic Pursuit of Inner Knowledge**: Drawing from Valentinian Gnosticism, there is a strong emphasis on personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) as the path to enlightenment. Inspired by texts like Saying 22 of the Gospel of Thomas, this pillar encourages the unification of opposites and the transcendence of material illusions to realize one's inherent divinity.

3. **Transformation Through Ecstatic Experience**: Influenced by Dionysian traditions, this pillar incorporates rituals and practices that involve ecstatic experiences, such as music, dance, or other forms of spiritual expression. These practices aim to transcend ordinary consciousness, facilitate personal transformation, and deepen the connection with the divine.
